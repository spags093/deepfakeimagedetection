# Deepfake Image Detection 
## Simple Web App to Detect Deepfake Images 

**Authors**: Jeff Spagnola

### Note on this App
This app is a work in progress and is part of a Capstone project for the Flatiron School Data Science Bootcamp.  This app was built off code for a classification task using CNN's to determine whether an image was real or a deepfake.  If you'd like to check out that project, please <a href = 'https://github.com/spags093/dsc-capstone-project-v2-onl01-dtsc-ft-070620'> click here</a>.

#### This is still a work in progress and I will add more to this readme in the future.  

#### Thanks!
